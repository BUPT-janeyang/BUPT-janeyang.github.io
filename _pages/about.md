I am also a member of Research Center of Network Monitoring and Analysis, and Center for Data Science of BUPT ([For more info about the Center](https://bupt.io/)).

In 1999 and 2007, I have obtained a master's degree and a doctor's degree in signal and information processing from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. At present, I am engaged in traffic monitoring, service identification, traffic modeling and user behavior analysis in IP networks at the Institute of Information and Communication Engineering Broadband Network Monitoring Teaching and Research Center. I have presided over the National Natural Science Foundation project "Study-based high-speed network flow classification technology research" and "network traffic analysis classification system research and development" and other enterprise cooperation projects. Meanwhile, I have published several papers in academic conferences and [publications](/publications), including IEEE JSAC, IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications and IEEE Trans. on Parallel and Distributed Systems.
